Estimate: 45 Hours

Looking at the coding workload based on how long it takes to write a single Line of Code we can estimate
that it will take __ hours to do the work. The addition code for the UI Component will take an additional 
~150 lines of code and the JavaScript and HTML part will take ~200 lines of code. The test suite is estimated
to be ~350 lines of code. If each line of code takes ~3 minutes (.05 hours) than that adds up to 35 hours 
(700 * .05 = 35). Adding on to the this the time it will take to do the additional documentation and team meetings,
an estimated 2 hours per team member, we are left with an estimate of 45 hours to complete Project 4.
