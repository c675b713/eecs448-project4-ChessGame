Estimate: 40 Hours

Looking at the coding workload based on how long it takes to write a single Line of Code we can estimate
that it will take 40 hours to do the work. The UI component will take ~400 lines of code to complete,   
the JavaScript and HTML part will take ~300 lines of code. If each line of code takes ~3 minutes (.05 hours) 
than that adds up to 30 hours (700 * .05 = 35). Adding onto this the time it will take to have team meetings, 
an estimated 1 hour per team member, we are left with an estimate of 40 hours to complete Project 3.
